# Mathematical-Constants-Using-Simulations
This repository contains codes to approximate the values of some mathematical constants using random numbers and simulations.
1. Pi: Here, pi is approximated by uniformaly throwing marbles in a square, followed by counting how many fall inside a circle inscribed in the square.
2. e: e is e is the smallest number n such that the sum of first n numbers drawn from a the uniform distribution(0, 1) is greater than 1 [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)#Stochastic_representations).
